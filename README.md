### HR Analytics Project - Atliq Technologies

Welcome to the repository for the HR Analytics Project developed for Atliq Technologies! This project focuses on analyzing employee attendance data over the last three months to offer actionable insights to the HR Generalist. Using Power BI Desktop, we employed data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) techniques to generate meaningful visualizations and metrics.

#### Problem Overview

Atliq Technologies' HR Generalist needed insights from attendance data collected over the past three months to understand employee attendance trends. The primary goal was to explore attendance patterns, identify retention strategies, and analyze factors contributing to sick leave rates. Additionally, we aimed to distinguish between the percentages of employees working from home (WFH) and those working from the office (WFO).

#### Data Source

The attendance data was provided in an Excel file. This data was processed through ETL operations to make it suitable for analysis.

#### Process Overview

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Defined the analysis scope, focusing on attendance patterns, retention strategies, and sick leave rates.
   
2. **Data Collection and Transformation:**
   - Retrieved attendance data from the Excel file.
   - Applied ETL processes to clean and format the data for analysis.

3. **Metrics Creation with DAX:**
   - Used Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create critical metrics such as attendance percentages, sick leave rates, and WFH versus WFO trends.

4. **Dashboard Creation in Power BI:**
   - Designed an interactive dashboard using Power BI Desktop.
   - Developed visualizations to provide insights into attendance trends, sick leave causes, and the balance between WFH and WFO.

#### How to Use the Dashboard

1. **Install Power BI Desktop:** Download Power BI Desktop from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494).
2. **Clone or Download the Repository:** Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. **Open the Power BI Project:** Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop, which contains the dashboard and data connections.
4. **Explore the Dashboard:** Once the data is loaded, interact with the dashboard to explore attendance patterns, sick leave statistics, and WFH/WFO breakdowns.

#### Project Outcome

This dashboard provides Atliq Technologies with data-driven insights to improve employee retention strategies. By understanding attendance patterns, the reasons behind sick leaves, and the distribution of WFH and WFO, the company can make informed decisions to enhance employee satisfaction and well-being.

Feel free to explore the dashboard and leverage these insights for better HR planning and decision-making.
